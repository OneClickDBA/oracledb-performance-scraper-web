# Grafana Dashboards

Grafana reads the PostgreSQL storage database directly. Configure a PostgreSQL
datasource that points at the same database used by the scraper.

The Docker Compose test stack provisions the datasource automatically from:

```text
docker-compose/grafana/datasources/datasources.yaml
```

Dashboard JSON files are stored in:

```text
docker-compose/grafana/dashboards/
```

## Included Dashboards

### Oracle Operational Overview

File:

```text
docker-compose/grafana/dashboards/oracle-operational-overview.json
```

Purpose:

- Collector success, freshness, duration, and errors.
- Database and instance state.
- Session and process utilization.
- Tablespace and ASM capacity.
- Oracle resource-limit pressure.
- Reset-aware system activity and wait-class rates.

Primary tables:

```text
oracle_database_status_samples
oracle_instance_samples
oracle_resource_limit_samples
oracle_tablespace_samples
oracle_asm_diskgroup_samples
oracle_system_counter_samples
oracle_wait_class_samples
oracle_scrape_status
```

The dashboard uses native typed operational data. It does not query
`oracle_metric_samples`.

### Database Activity History (DAH)

File:

```text
docker-compose/grafana/dashboards/database-activity-history.json
```

Purpose:

- Average active sessions by wait class.
- Top SQL by active samples.
- Top sessions by active samples.
- Activity by `SQL_ID`.
- Recent activity samples.
- Top wait events.
- Module/program activity.

Primary table:

```text
oracle_database_activity_samples
```

This dashboard is the AAS-style historical activity view. It intentionally uses
high-cardinality fields that should not be Prometheus labels.

The `Activity Source` variable keeps `SESSION`, `ASH`, and migrated `LEGACY`
rows separate. `SESSION` is the default collector. `ASH` appears only when the
scraper was explicitly configured to use Oracle ASH and the operator accepted
responsibility for verifying Diagnostics Pack licensing.

### Oracle SQL Performance

File:

```text
docker-compose/grafana/dashboards/oracle-sql-performance.json
```

Purpose:

- Top SQL by elapsed time delta.
- Top SQL by CPU time delta.
- Top SQL by User I/O wait delta.
- SQL efficiency outliers.
- Short SQL text previews in ranking tables.

Primary tables:

```text
oracle_sql_samples
oracle_sql_texts
oracle_sql_plans
```

This dashboard is the category overview. Select a `SQL_ID` in any ranking table
to open the same database, SQL ID, and time range in the Top Consumers
dashboard. Ranking tables intentionally show only a short SQL preview.

### Oracle SQL Top Consumers

File:

```text
docker-compose/grafana/dashboards/oracle-sql-top-consumers.json
```

Purpose:

- Top 20 SQL consumers by elapsed-time delta for the selected time range.
- One-minute average database-time contribution for elapsed, CPU, User I/O,
  application, concurrency, and cluster time.
- One-minute average execution, row-processing, and parse-call rates.
- One-minute average buffer-get, disk-read, and direct-write rates.
- Category ranks and the dominant measured pressure for every top consumer.
- Available plan hashes and cached execution-plan operations.
- Complete `SQL_FULLTEXT` for the selected `SQL_ID`.

The top table is the entry point for statement-level troubleshooting. Select a
`SQL_ID` to populate the detailed graphs, full SQL text, and plans below it.
Select `PLAN_HASH_VALUE` when a statement has multiple collected plans. The
plan panel displays the cached `GV$SQL_PLAN` operation tree, objects, optimizer
estimates, partition bounds, and predicates; it does not contain runtime
`ALLSTATS` values.

Plan-operation colors identify access and join methods for visual scanning;
they do not classify an operation as universally good or bad. Full application
table scans and Cartesian joins are red, index access is green, hash joins are
yellow, nested loops are blue, merge joins are orange, and sorts are purple.
Oracle fixed-table scans are not treated as application-table full scans.

The `review_signal` column highlights an initial investigation point:

- `CARTESIAN`: the operation or options contain `CARTESIAN`.
- `FULL SCAN`: a `TABLE ACCESS` operation has a `FULL` option.
- `TEMP`: the optimizer estimates non-zero temporary space.
- `HIGH ESTIMATE`: estimated cardinality is at least 100,000 rows, estimated
  bytes are at least 100 MiB, or optimizer cost is at least 10,000.

These are heuristics. Object size, selectivity, actual row counts, and workload
frequency still determine whether an operation is a performance problem.

The top table totals counter deltas over the selected dashboard range. Detail
graphs first divide each delta by the actual interval between PostgreSQL
samples, then average those rates into one-minute buckets. This avoids a
misleading sawtooth when a cumulative Oracle counter changes less frequently
than the scraper interval. A zero remains meaningful: no corresponding work
completed during that observation interval.

SQL text and plan details are collected on the bounded `performance.sqlPlans`
schedule. A top consumer can therefore appear before its detail is collected,
or after its Oracle cursor has aged out. The dashboard reports that state as
`Not collected or aged out` instead of hiding the SQL statistics.

### Current Sessions and Blocking

File:

```text
docker-compose/grafana/dashboards/oracle-sessions-and-blocking.json
```

Purpose:

- Current active SQL sessions.
- Current waiters by event.
- Long-running active sessions.
- Blocking sessions.
- Session inventory by user, module, and program.

Primary tables:

```text
oracle_session_samples
oracle_blocking_session_samples
```

This dashboard is the current-state triage view. Historical active-session
graphs live in the DAH dashboard instead.

## Importing Manually

If you are not using the Compose provisioning files:

1. Create a Grafana PostgreSQL datasource.
2. Set its UID to `PostgreSQL`, or edit the dashboard JSON files to match your
   datasource UID.
3. Import the JSON dashboards from `docker-compose/grafana/dashboards/`.

## Required Data

The dashboards assume the scraper is writing these tables:

- `oracle_database_activity_samples`
- `oracle_sql_samples`
- `oracle_sql_texts`
- `oracle_sql_plans`
- `oracle_session_samples`
- `oracle_blocking_session_samples`
- `oracle_database_status_samples`
- `oracle_instance_samples`
- `oracle_resource_limit_samples`
- `oracle_tablespace_samples`
- `oracle_asm_diskgroup_samples`
- `oracle_system_counter_samples`
- `oracle_wait_class_samples`
- `oracle_scrape_status`

If a dashboard is empty, verify:

- `metrics.scrapeInterval` is configured.
- PostgreSQL `output.postgresql.url` is correct.
- the Oracle monitoring user can query the relevant `GV$` views.
- Grafana time range includes recently collected rows.

## Grafana Alerting

The Docker Compose stack also provisions PostgreSQL-backed starter alert rules
for collection freshness, Oracle connectivity, tablespaces, resource limits,
and ASM. See [Grafana Alerting](../configuration/grafana-alerting.md) for rule
deployment, contact points, and the required independent monitoring of the
scraper, PostgreSQL, and Grafana themselves.
